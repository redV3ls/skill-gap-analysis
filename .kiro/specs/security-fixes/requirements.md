# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical security vulnerabilities and infrastructure issues identified in the Clearsight IP API codebase. The fixes are essential for production readiness and include authentication security, database integrity, proper infrastructure configuration, and input validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Hardcoded Credentials

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all hardcoded credentials removed from the codebase, so that the system is not vulnerable to credential exposure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration files are reviewed THEN no hardcoded passwords or credentials SHALL be present
2. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL require proper environment-based authentication setup
3. WHEN admin users are needed THEN they SHALL be created through secure administrative processes

### Requirement 2: Implement Proper Password Hashing

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want passwords to be hashed using industry-standard bcrypt, so that user credentials are properly protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user password is stored THEN it SHALL be hashed using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
2. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL verify passwords using bcrypt comparison
3. WHEN existing SHA-256 hashes are encountered THEN they SHALL be migrated to bcrypt on next login

### Requirement 3: Enable Cloudflare Bindings

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Cloudflare D1 database and KV cache bindings to be properly configured in wrangler.toml, so that the Workers application can function with its data layer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the wrangler.toml is configured THEN D1 database bindings SHALL be uncommented and properly configured
2. WHEN the wrangler.toml is configured THEN KV namespace bindings SHALL be uncommented and properly configured
3. WHEN the application deploys to Cloudflare Workers THEN it SHALL have access to database and cache resources
4. WHEN health checks run THEN they SHALL properly verify D1 and KV connectivity

### Requirement 4: Add Input Validation Middleware

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all API inputs to be validated and sanitized, so that the system is protected from injection attacks and malformed data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint receives a request THEN all inputs SHALL be validated against defined schemas
2. WHEN invalid input is received THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
3. WHEN input contains potentially dangerous content THEN it SHALL be sanitized or rejected

### Requirement 5: Implement Proper Error Sanitization

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want error responses to not leak sensitive information, so that attackers cannot gain system insights from error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN stack traces SHALL NOT be exposed to clients
2. WHEN errors are logged THEN sensitive data SHALL be redacted
3. WHEN database errors occur THEN generic error messages SHALL be returned to clients

### Requirement 6: Add Database Constraints and Indexes

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want proper constraints and indexes in place, so that data integrity is maintained and queries perform efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database tables are created THEN all foreign key relationships SHALL be properly constrained
2. WHEN queries are executed THEN appropriate indexes SHALL be available for performance
3. WHEN data is inserted THEN database-level validation SHALL enforce data integrity

### Requirement 7: Enable and Fix Test Suite

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a working test suite that works with Cloudflare Workers environment, so that code changes can be validated and regressions prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL execute successfully using Miniflare for Workers simulation
2. WHEN critical functionality is tested THEN tests SHALL cover authentication, database operations, and API endpoints using mocked D1 and KV
3. WHEN tests fail THEN they SHALL provide clear feedback about what needs to be fixed
4. WHEN CI/CD runs THEN tests SHALL execute in GitHub Actions environment

### Requirement 8: Add Environment Variable Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the Cloudflare Workers application to validate required environment variables and secrets on startup, so that configuration issues are caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Worker starts THEN it SHALL validate all required environment variables and Cloudflare secrets are present
2. WHEN required secrets (JWT_SECRET) are missing THEN the Worker SHALL fail to start with clear error messages
3. WHEN Cloudflare bindings are missing THEN the Worker SHALL provide helpful error messages
4. WHEN environment variables have invalid values THEN the Worker SHALL provide helpful validation messages
